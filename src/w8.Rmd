## Review Plan

- We will review three generalizations of the LATE Theorem
    1. Multiple instruments
    2. LATE with covariates
    3. Treatment intensity: The ACR Theorem
- Again, these are not about how to estimate IV models, but how to intereprete IV estimates

#Multiple Instruments
## Set up

- Consider two mutually exclusive instruments $\rZ_{1i}$ and $\rZ_{2i}$
    - What does mutally exclusive mean? 
    - Think of a instrument set that are captured by a categorical variable.
- Suppose both of them are valid instruments satisfied assumptions for the LATE Theorem. So:
    - $\rZ_{1i}$ gives $\EE{ \rY_{1i} - \rY_{0i} \mid \rD^{\rZ_1}_{1i} - \rD^{\rZ_1}_{0i} }$
    - $\rZ_{2i}$ gives $\EE{ \rY_{1i} - \rY_{0i} \mid \rD^{\rZ_2}_{1i} - \rD^{\rZ_2}_{0i} }$
